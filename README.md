# SunPy Sample Data Repository

This is the versioned source for the SunPy and affiliated package sample data.
What is put here is mirrored to data.sunpy.org.

If you want to add data to this repository you will need to use Git Large File Storage (LFS) https://git-lfs.github.com/.
This allows the data files to be replaced with text pointers inside Git.

You will need to install git lfs (see https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation).
Following this and git lfs is setup on your system, you can continue with the typical steps of
committing a new file to your branch and making a PR to this repo.
